# Data structures
My personal implementation of common data structures

## Requirements
You'll need **SCons** to build it. You can install it with **pip**, **brew**, or almost any package manager.

Otherwise you can run the following Docker container

## Usage

```bash
scons -j3
./linked_list
./dynamic_array
./stack
```
